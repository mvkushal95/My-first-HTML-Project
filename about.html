<p>Hey, I’m Kushal — an Ad Ops & Analytics Specialist with 8 years of hands-on experience across Google Ad Manager, CM360, DV360, and a growing list of data tools. I’ve worked on both display and video ecosystems, solving complex delivery, measurement, and optimization challenges.</p>
<p>I don’t just follow the numbers — I speak their language. Now, I’m expanding my skillset into front-end development, building web-based tools and dashboards that make ad operations smarter and more transparent.</p>
<p>Whether it's SQL, GA4, GTM, or HTML, I believe in connecting the dots between data, tech, and business. My goal? To keep leveling up — not just as a specialist, but as a strategic problem-solver in the evolving digital ecosystem.</p>
